This complex consists of two identical stacked rings, each containing eight different proteins. Unfolded polypeptides enter the central cavity of the complex and are folded in an ATP-dependent manner. The complex folds various proteins, including actin and tubulin. Alternate transcriptional splice variants have been characterized for this gene. In addition, a pseudogene of this gene has been found on chromosome 8. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2010]"}
