Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. This gene is located on chromosome 12 and encodes a replication-independent histone that is a variant H2A histone. The protein is divergent at the C-terminus compared to the consensus H2A histone family member. This gene also encodes an antimicrobial peptide with antibacterial and antifungal activity.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]"}
