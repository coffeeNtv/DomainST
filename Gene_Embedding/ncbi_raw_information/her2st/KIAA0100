This gene also has increased expression in prostrate cancer cells relative to normal prostrate tissues. Expression of this gene is negatively regulated by direct binding of the microRNA miR-195 to its 3' UTR. miR-195 has been shown to modulate the invasiveness of prostrate cancer cells and xenograft metastases by downgrading expression of this gene. In mouse, the protein encoded by this gene was identified as an antigen on acute monocytic leukemia cells. In human, alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms; some of these isoforms are predicted to contain an RNA pol II promoter FMP27 protein domain and a Golgi-body-localization APT1 domain.
