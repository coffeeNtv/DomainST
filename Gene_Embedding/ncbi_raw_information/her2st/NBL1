These proteins are secreted, and act as BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) antagonists by binding to BMPs and preventing them from interacting with their receptors. They may thus play an important role during growth and development. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified for this gene. Read-through transcripts between this locus and the upstream mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system 1 gene (GeneID 440574) have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]"}
