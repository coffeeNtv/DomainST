PcG gene products form complexes via protein-protein interaction and maintain the transcription repression of genes involved in embryogenesis, cell cycles, and tumorigenesis. This protein was shown to act as a negative regulator of transcription and has tumor suppressor activity. The expression of this gene was detected in various tumor cells, but is limited in neural organs in normal tissues. Knockout studies in mice suggested that this protein may negatively regulate the expression of different cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors, and thus plays an important role in lymphocyte differentiation and migration, as well as in immune responses.
