Studies suggest that this gene plays a role in ER proliferation, secretory pathways and secretory cell differentiation, and mediation of ER-microtubule interactions. Alternative splicing has been observed and protein isoforms are characterized by regions of N-terminal decapeptide and C-terminal heptad repeats. Splicing of the tandem repeats results in variations in ribosome-binding affinity and secretory function. The full-length nature of variants which differ in repeat length has not been determined. Pseudogenes of this gene have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 7, and RRBP1 has been excluded as a candidate gene in the cause of Alagille syndrome, the result of a mutation in a nearby gene on chromosome 20p12.
