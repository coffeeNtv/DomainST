Three main groups of actin isoforms have been identified in vertebrate animals: alpha, beta, and gamma. The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins co-exist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton and as mediators of internal cell motility. Actin gamma 1, encoded by this gene, is a cytoplasmic actin found in all cell types. Mutations in this gene are associated with DFNA20/26, a subtype of autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensorineural progressive hearing loss and also with Baraitser-Winter syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2017]"}
