The encoded protein plays a critical role in cell proliferation, differentiation and migration by binding to fibroblast growth factors and potentiating their biological effects on target cells. The encoded protein may also play a role in tumor growth as an angiogenic switch molecule, and expression of this gene has been associated with several types of cancer including pancreatic and colorectal adenocarcinoma. A pseudogene of this gene is also located on the short arm of chromosome 4. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2011]"}
