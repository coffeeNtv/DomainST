Proteins encoded by this gene family are low in molecular weight, are cysteine-rich, lack aromatic residues, and bind divalent heavy metal ions, altering the intracellular concentration of heavy metals in the cell. These proteins act as anti-oxidants, protect against hydroxyl free radicals, are important in homeostatic control of metal in the cell, and play a role in detoxification of heavy metals. The encoded protein interacts with the protein encoded by the homeobox containing 1 gene in some cell types, controlling intracellular zinc levels, affecting apoptotic and autophagy pathways. Some polymorphisms in this gene are associated with an increased risk of cancer. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2017]"}
