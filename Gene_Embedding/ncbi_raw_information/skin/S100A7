S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein differs from the other S100 proteins of known structure in its lack of calcium binding ability in one EF-hand at the N-terminus. The protein is overexpressed in hyperproliferative skin diseases, exhibits antimicrobial activities against bacteria and induces immunomodulatory activities. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]"}
