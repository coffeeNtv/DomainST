The 20S core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. The 19S regulator is composed of a base, which contains 6 ATPase subunits and 2 non-ATPase subunits, and a lid, which contains up to 10 non-ATPase subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. This gene encodes a member of the proteasome subunit S3 family that functions as one of the non-ATPase subunits of the 19S regulator lid. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene are associated with neutrophil count. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2012]"}
