Its mRNA is highly structured and contains an oligopyrimidine tract (5'-TOP) in its 5' untranslated region that functions to repress its translation under quiescent conditions. The encoded protein is involved in a variety of cellular pathways, including apoptosis, protein synthesis and cell division. It binds to and stabilizes microtubules, and removal of this protein through phosphorylation is required for progression through mitotic and meiotic cell divisions. This gene is known to play a role in carcinogenesis, and is upregulated in some cancer cells. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
